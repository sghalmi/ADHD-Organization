# Study Smart ADHD
The goal is to develop a website to assist college students with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) who face challenges in their academic lives.\
**Fetures that The Website Will Contain:**\
ADHD significantly impacts college students' cognitive abilities, hindering their assignment completion. After researching various studies and sources, I've identified three common issues affecting their academic success and recommended website features to address these challenges. 
1. Working Memory: Implement a calendar for scheduling assignments and events, along with a class summary feature to help students recap lecture content.

2. Distractions: Integrate the Pomodoro technique into the website to aid students in managing distractions during study sessions.

3. Procrastination: Enhance assignment management by adding an assignment checklist to break down larger tasks and include daily to-do lists for scheduling daily goals.

These methods aim to support students with ADHD who are facing academic challenges.\
